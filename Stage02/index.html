          <p class="about">
            Christina's World is a 1948 painting by American painter Andrew Wyeth and one of the best-known American
            paintings of the mid-20th century. It is a tempera work done in a realist style, depicting a woman
            semi-reclining on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, looking up at a gray house on the horizon; a
            barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house. It is owned by the Museum of Modern Art
            in New York as part of its permanent collection.

          <p class="about">
            MacMonnies concentrated his artistic efforts on painting from 1900-1904, producing at least nine
            self-portraits. Here, he stands with brush and palette in front of his copy of Diego Velázquez’s "The
            Drinkers," also known as "The Triumph of Bacchus" (1628-29), which appears in reverse due to MacMonnies
            posing before a mirror. MacMonnies’s broad and loose brushwork emulates Velázquez’s painterly style in
            evident admiration for the Spanish Baroque master. In February 1904, MacMonnies copied paintings in Madrid’s
            Museo Nacional del Prado, which includes the "Triumph of Bacchus" in its extensive collection of works by
            Velázquez.

          <p class="about">
            This unfinished portrayal of a young woman with disheveled hair (hence its nickname, scapigliata) is
            principally a brush drawing with some pigment, its treatment similar to other incomplete works by the
            artist. Yet the contrast between the sketchiness of the hair and neck and the refined modeling of the face
            must be intentional. It suggests that Leonardo was inspired by a passage (well-known during the Renaissance)
            by the ancient Roman author Pliny the Elder. Pliny remarked that the great artist Apelles left his last
            depiction of the Venus of Cos incomplete and that the work was nonetheless more admired than his first,
            finished painting of the goddess.

          <p class="about">
            Gift drawings can be considered an independent art genre. They differ from ordinary drawings and etudes in
            more elaboration and completeness. This type of drawing appeared in Italy at the beginning of the 15th
            century. The earliest extant of this kind of drawings was made in about 1500 by Leonardo da Vinci. In the
            1530s, Michelangelo created a series of similar drawings. It includes, in particular, the “Dream of human
            life”, approx. 1533.

          <p class="about">
            The Terracotta Army is a collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the
            first
            emperor of China. It is a form of funerary art buried with the emperor in 210–209 BCE with the purpose of
            protecting the emperor in his afterlife.
            The figures, dating from approximately the late third century BCE, were discovered in 1974 by local farmers
            in Lintong County, outside Xi'an, Shaanxi, China. The figures vary in height according to their roles, the
            tallest being the generals. The figures include warriors, chariots and horses. Estimates from 2007 were that
            the three pits containing the Terracotta Army held more than 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses,
            and
            150 cavalry horses, the majority of which remained buried in the pits near Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum.Other
            terracotta non-military figures were found in other pits, including officials, acrobats, strongmen, and
            musicians.

          <p class="about">
            The statue of Laocoön and His Sons, also called the Laocoön Group (Italian: Gruppo del Laocoonte), has been
            one of the most famous ancient sculptures ever since it was excavated in Rome in 1506 and placed on public
            display in the Vatican Museums, where it remains. It is very likely the same statue that was praised in
            the highest terms by the main Roman writer on art, Pliny the Elder. The figures are near life-size and
            the group is a little over 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in height, showing the Trojan priest Laocoön and his sons
            Antiphantes and Thymbraeus being attacked by sea serpents
